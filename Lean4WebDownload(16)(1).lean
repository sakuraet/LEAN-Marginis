# More reverse mathematics of the Heine-Borel Theorem (2012)
JEFFRY L HIRST & JESSICA MILLER, JLA 2012

On page 2 of the paper,
"X is a subset of [0,1] and for every closed (in the topology on ℝ) subset A ⊆ X, every open cover of A contains a finite sub cover"
Here we prove a modfied version of the Heine-Borel Theorem in the ℝ
