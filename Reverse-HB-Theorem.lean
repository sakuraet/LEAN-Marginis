# More reverse mathematics of the Heine-Borel Theorem (2012)
JEFFRY L HIRST & JESSICA MILLER, JLA 2012

On page 2 of the paper,
"HB(X): X is a subset of [0,1] and for every closed (in the topology on ℝ) subset A ⊆ X, every open cover of A contains a finite sub cover"

Here we prove a scheme formalizing the Heine-Borel Theorem for subsets of [0,1] in ℝ. This will be later used to give characterization of subsets of [0,1] for which the HB theorem is equivalent to Weak Konig's Lemma (WKL0) in the big five reverse mathematics axiom systems.

   Thus the usual Heine-Borel theorem states "If X is closed and bounded ↔ X is compact thus every open cover of X has a finite subcover."

On page 2 of the paper,
"S(X): X is a subset of [0,1] and there is a countable dense in itself set Y which is contained in every closed superset of X" 

Here we prove a scheme formalizing the S(X) proposition for subsets of [0,1] in ℝ. This will be later used to give characterization of subsets of [0,1] which will be used in theorem 2 to prove Weak Konig's Lemma (WKL0) and Recursive Comprehension Axiom (RCA0). Thus, theorem 2 states "If S(X) holds, then the Heine-Borel theorem for X implies WKL0. That is, S(X) implies HB(X) → WKL0." In order to do so, we prove scenarios of when S(X) holds or not.
